You can walk everywhere... for coffee, for groceries, for a night out, for breathtaking views of the Puget Sound.","What's up with the free pillows?  Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases. And if you leave the pillows behind, they'll be donated to a local women's shelter that ","Convenient bus stops are just down the block, if you're headed downtown or further afield to explore.

Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.

Belltown is also an easy walk, just on the other side of Seattle Center - I walk to work in Belltown and it usually takes me about 25 minutes.

They're usually less expensive than taxis, but you'll need to download the apps to your smartphone in order to use them. You can get your first ride for free up to $20 by using the code uvgmm for Uber or libby111 for Lyft! Bus: There are bus stops all over - the closest ones are less than 5 mins walking. The cost is $2.50, cash only. Monorail/Light Rail: The monorail at the Space Needle is 15 mins walking, and that will take you to 5th x Pine downtown for $2 (cash only). From there you can cross the street to the light rail station for quick and cheap access to the stadiums, Amtrak station, and airport. The light rail kiosks accept both cash and credit cards. Bike: Seattle now has a bike share program called Pronto. 24 hour passes are $8, and 3-day passes are $16.

Our home was renovated and restored with health & safety in mind, especially the elimination/reduction of indoor allergens, toxins & other pollutants.  (For this reason, we have no carpets, just hardwood & slate floors, with radiant heat.)  Pillows tend to house a LOT of allergens over time, even when just used by a single owner.  The statistics make many people feel pretty queasy but, essentially, pillows become great breeding grounds for bacteria and dust mites, not to mention drool, hair oils and perspiration. Since most people sweat more than a pint a night, the pillow can also easily trap mildew and mold. We use dust mite protectors for mattresses and duvets, but haven't found any that work well for pillows that maintain comfort/elasticity without the use of outgassing materials.  So, I let the guests take their pillows but ask that they leave the pillowcases.

I've been a Queen Anne resident for a frighteningly long time - 26 years this fall. I raised two kids here, and even though one is 22 and away at college and the other a senior in high school, they both still swear they'll live on Queen Anne. I commute over the bridge to the east side to work as an attorney for a ""large technology company,"" but am a Seattleite through and through. It's a big house, and my daughter and I would be happy to share part of it. We'd be pretty chill hosts, mostly would just do our own thing without much interaction with our occasional guests, though we'd be pleased to have you and show you the ropes.

We are eager to get to know Europe as the people that live here know it (not like the traditional American tourist does through cruise ships and museums).  We have learned through our travels that the advice of the local resident is always better than a guide book or brocures at a hotel, so we look forward to meeting all the wonderful people on our travels and learning from them.  

Alicia minored in Spanish in college, lived in Salamanca for a summer and speaks well enough to get by, John took some French also and can read for comprehension but does not do well in conversation (hopefully our trip will improve both of our language skills!).  

We enjoy trying all sorts of new food and wine and are very adventurous in that area.  We like to go out in the evenings, have a few drinks and maybe do some dancing.  We are also perfectly happy staying in and having a glass of wine on the patio while the sun sets.  

John is a great cook and Alicia is great at cleaning, tidying up and great with kids as she is a nanny in the States. We have no problem pitching in and helping out with dinner or the chores when the time calls.  

I hope this helps shed some light on who we are, though we know that we can't tell everything in this little description.  We have many hobbies and interests and hope to pick up more on our travels, if you are curious or would like to know more about us, Please Please ask us, we are more than willing to share!

Thank you for takig the time to read about us, we hope to meet you in the future!

As a host: Think Singapore airlines first-class, not a Delta red-eye the night before Thanksgiving. I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect. When you stay at my home, I want you to feel like it's your home. Kick back and relax. If you need a pointer or 2, feel free to ask. I speak French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish and am learning Arabic right now. I grew up in a French province and used to bartend so I can probably pick you out a drink if you're in need of libation. I'm also a foodie that both eats out a lot as well as cooks; I can certainly appreciate a judiciously prepared bite and LOVE LOVE LOVE to help people find a satisfying meal. Random jobs I've held the past of note: stunt woman, bouncer, door-to-door sales, microbiologist, human/bovine tissue engineer. Right now, I'm a software architect. My husband also works in software and we have a 1 year daughter who loves to wriggle and play. He speaks Arabic, French and German. She speaks to turtles, pandas and coffee mugs.

As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on. My next trip is to the French/Italian Riviera for some serious R&R.

The character of the neighbourhood has always been a bit rough and tumble, influenced heavily by the Scandinavians and others who came here to build, repair and work the boats that catch most of the US's salmon.

But things change, and the gentrification that's morphed other formerly blue collar neighbourhoods, like Brooklyn, NY, has landed here in Ballard, too. Great cafes, restaurants (some of the best new places to eat in the US), shops, coffee roasters and beer makers have all been popping up and helping define the new Old Ballard as smart, hip, well-heeled and discriminating.

Ballard used to be a small town independent of Seattle, so it offers all the entertainment and amenities of a city in one neighborhood! Micro-brews, restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques. It even has a jazz club with music almost every night of the week.  On Sundays downtown Ballard transforms into a Farmers Market with local food and products being peddled.   My favorite Ballard attraction is the Ballard Locks. From June to October you can watch the great salmon migration at the locks as they jump the fish ladder. Year round you can watch the boats move through the ship canal as they head out into the Sound. The Locks host various cultural events in their botanical garden during the summer, such as music and tours. Events are free to the public.","We have a small, cuddly dog named Giacomo.

We are Yedida and Vincent. 

We are a newly married couple with a healthy curiosity for travel and culture. For our honeymoon we backpacked around the world in 10 unforgettable months. We came back to the states to attend Graduate School at the UW and put down roots here in gorgeous Seattle. I, Yedida, am originally from Portland, OR and Vincent is from Eastern WA, so we know the Pacific NW like the back of our hand. 

We enjoy cooking, being outdoors, exercising, reading and dancing (well, that's just me!). Travel remains our number one love. I remain loosely connected to the international community through my work as an Italian instructor. 

We are very open people who are used to travel, meeting new people and sharing community space. During our honeymoon we utilized both (website hidden) and WWOOF (World Wide Organization of Organic Farming) to gain a deeper perspective of the countries we were visiting. Nevertheless, we absolutely respect privacy and the need for quiet or alone time. We will be happy to let you do your own thing if that's your preference, but we will be equally happy to share the communal spaces in our home. 

We have a roommate, Kevin, who occupies the basement floor of the house. Kevin is an accomplished pastry chef and works a lot in the summer. You will catch him in the kitchen cooking up all sorts of yummy treats for us!

My dream is to use the profits of our labor to start a non-profit company that will help disadvantaged people around the world, afford medical care. Specifically a program that will send doctors from the US to the third world, to train mid-level healthcare workers to effectively treat the sick. I believe that everyone should have equal access to healthcare, regardless of socioeconomic status.

I joke around a lot and act like a kid when I'm around cute little pets. I love plants and growing plants. If I get an avocado (yum!) I plant the seed.

Other favorites include Theo Chocolate Factory (which offers tours and free samples) and the Book Larder (which has cooking classes in addition to its excellent selection of cookbooks).  We also love to take","We list this space as housing up to three guests, and it should be noted that we offer a queen sized bed in the bedroom plus a couch in the living room.  The couch is not a not a pull-out bed, but it is comfortable and sleeps a fully grown adult.  We can provide bedding to fit it.","Our condo is close to several King County Metro bus routes with frequent service.  You can also take a bus downtown to connect with Link Light Rail (which goes to SeaTac Airport).  For buses, you'll want to have exact fare when you board, or consider an ORCA transit card if your stay is longer.  Light rail tickets can be purchased by credit card at the station. Seattle offers access to Car2Go (one of the largest fleets in the country), ZipCar, and Pronto Cycle Share.  Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar all have a presence in the city, as do taxis and towncars. If you have a car, our neighborhood has on-street parking.  It's free, with no marked restrictions.  Depending on the night you visit, there may be plentiful spaces, or you may need to circle around.  A space can usually be found within one block.",https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/105070835/b70441aa_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=small&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a1.muscache.com/im/pictures/105070835/b70441aa_original.jpg?aki_policy=medium,https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/105070835/b70441aa_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,https://a1.muscache.com/ac/pictures/105070835/b70441aa_original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&size=x_large_cover&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70,5992456,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/5992456,Hannah,2013-04-18,"Seattle, Washington, United States","A Seattle transplant from Colorado, I spend my days trying to keep up with my students at a French bilingual middle school.

Three years later, we got married and decided to settle in Seattle. But we still love to explore the world together, and we use AirBnB to find cool places to stay. We're new to hosting, but I think that being frequent guests gives us a good sense of how to be good hosts!

I work in alternative health, as a practitioner of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT). Amanda's a yoga teacher and doula, working with pregnant women. We both love to cook, dance, read and explore different cultures. 

We're excited to meet our new guests. We can talk your ear off telling you about our favorite places to visit and eat in our city, but we will happily leave you in peace if you just want to do your own thing!

I run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project.  Mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  I (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. Maybe I'll take you out on the water if interested! 

Check out my venues by searching ""Fremont Abbey"" or ""Ballard Homestead"" for concert listings.

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy B&B or hotel. 
  
Though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. Generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

Our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland, Copenhagen, Berlin, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, Honduras, Mexico, Scotland, Ireland, England, Canada, NYC, Austin, California, etc. 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc.

We  discovered vacation apartment living some years ago in Paris, in the Marais, totally immersed in the neighborhood, no tourists around.  I will never stay in a hotel again, if I can help it. Living where the locals live and to interact with them is a huge part of the experience.  

I was born in Germany and came to California when I was very young.  You might say that I came on a whim, with hardly an idea what I was getting into.  But it all worked out beautifully.   
Renting to vacationers has always been a dream, one might say, it has been on the ""bucket list.""  I rent out a room in my own house and have met so many wonderful people, mostly from countries other than the USA.

We have a small back yard, patio for a cup of tea and plenty of sunshine on the covered/shaded front patio/porch area. BBQ in back too.  Shared kitchen and dining room is nice for cooking. Upstairs rooms have access to the Reading Room with a couch, table, chairs, and nice south facing windows for brunch.  Easy access from the airport too, just take the Light Rail to downtown and grab ",none,"We're just a few blocks to some of the best coffeeshops (in the world?) like Zoka and maybe a mile to Lighthouse Roasters, 8 blocks to Chocolati, 4 blocks to the lake for walking, swimming or biking (great 3+ mile trail around the lake - very popular walking spot).","","Only 1 short block to the main bus line (#16) to get downtown or to University of Washington (#44 is about 5 min walk).   No car needed.  Easy from Sea-Tac airport also, we recommend the Ligt Rail to downtown and then a bus or cab/Lyft/uber to save $.  We're near Tangletown which has restaurants and bars too. 45th street has tons of restaurants, clubs, bars, shops, a full size grocery store, etc. all within easy walking distance.

I run arts & culture nonprofit venues here in Seattle and consult on venue designs/remodels in other cities with my Lonely Buildings project.  Mature, quiet, professional, very active and not home all that often really.  I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.  I (almost) always know where the good concerts and shows are, sometimes free ones too!   I play a lot of volleyball at the beach or park and paddleboard often as well. Maybe I'll take you out on the water if interested! 

Check out my venues by searching ""Fremont Abbey"" or ""Ballard Homestead"" for concert listings.

My housemates and I love sharing the house with people from near or far who have a positive outlook on life and who can respect the space and understand it's a real home not a fancy B&B or hotel. 
  
Though we're not around much, sometimes great conversations do spring up in the evening if the schedules align so that's always fun. Generally it's a pretty quiet house for resting and relaxing. 

Our rooms won't always be available as we typically have long term housemates, but just depends on the time of year and our vacations.

I love to travel and have been so far to Iceland, Copenhagen, Berlin, Haiti, New Zealand, Australia, Honduras, Mexico, Scotland, Ireland, England, Canada, NYC, Austin, California, etc. 

I love hot sauces and fun interesting foods, talking about social change, neuroscience & psychology, etc. 

Paddleboarding and beach volleyball are pretty much my favorite activities these days but hiking, backpacking and sailing are awesome too. 

cheers,
-Nathan Marion",within an hour,80%,100%,f,"https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/946910/profile_pic/1437724094/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=50:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70","https://a0.muscache.com/ac/users/946910/profile_pic/1437724094/original.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&crop=w:w;*,*&crop=h:h;*,*&resize=225:*&output-format=jpg&output-quality=70",Wallingford,2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'google', 'reviews', 'jumio']",t,t,"Wallingford Ave N, Seattle, WA 98103, United States",Wallingford,Wallingford,Other neighborhoods,Seattle,WA,98103,Seattle,"Seattle, WA",US,United States,47.66817599754457,-122.33737078892932,t,House,Private room,3,1.0,1,2,Real Bed,"{Internet,""Wireless Internet"",Kitchen,""Free Parking on Premises"",Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke Detector"",""Carbon Monoxide Detector"",""First Aid Kit"",""Safety Card"",""Fire Extinguisher"",Essentials}",,$45.00,$275.00,$950.00,$250.00,$20.00,1,$10.00,3,31,2 weeks ago,t,0,3,33,308,2016-01-04,15,2012-08-01,2015-08-01,97,10,9,10,10,10,10,f,,WASHINGTON,f,strict,f,f,2,0.36

The park sits on the north end of the lake, a 19.1 acre public park built on the site of a former gasification plant, with ruins and pieces of the old plant still standing and built into the park. The park offers grassy hills for kite flying, picnics, and wide vistas of the lake and city. The Burke-Gilman Trail runs along the northern edge of the park. Seaplanes scoot in and out of Lake Union, on their way to and from the San Juan Islands and British Columbia. The lake shores are lined with houseboats, and commercial and private docks for owners and renters of tugs, yachts, tour ships, sailboats, kayaks and canoes. The Center for Wooden Boats is a nautical museum on the south shore, with historical boats, sailing events, classes and workshops.","Living on the water is a Eco Conscious experience.
